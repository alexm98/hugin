Hugin EO: Machine Learning for Earth Observation made easy
==========================================================

Hugin helps scientists run Machine Learning experiments on geospatial raster data.

Hugin was developed as part of the ESA funded ML4EO_

Overall Hugin aims to facilitate experimentation with multiple machine learning problems, like:
 * Classification
 * Segmentation
 * Super-Resolution

Currently Hugin builds on top of the Keras machine learning library but it also aims to support, in the future, additional backends like scikit-learn.
